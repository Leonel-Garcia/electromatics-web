# Clean Code Compliance Skill

## Core Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Refactor duplicated logic into shared utilities or base classes.
2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering; choose the simplest solution that works and is maintainable.
3. **Meaningful Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `calculateNodeVoltage` instead of `calcV`).
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module should have one reason to change.

## Coding Standards

- **Comments**: Focus on the _why_ rather than the _how_.
- **Consistency**: Match the existing coding style of the project (indentation, naming conventions).
- **Refactoring**: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
